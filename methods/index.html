Concordances are often a first step in analysis. The concordance allows a researcher to see how a word is used and in what contexts. Most concordancing tools allow sorting of results by either preceding or following words – the coloured text in the example below shows that in this case the results have been sorted hierarchically on the three following words. This possibility can help in discovering patterns of co-occurrence. Concordances are also very useful when looking for good examples to illustrate a point. (The type of display seen in the example is often referred to as KeyWord In Context – KWIC. There is a possibility of confusion here, as there is a separate analytic method commonly referred to as <a href=#keywords rel>Keywords</a>.)</p><figure><img src=https://atap.edu.au/concordance.png alt="Example of a concordance"></figure><p>(The example here was produced by <a href=https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Antconc</a>)</p><p>This <a href=https://slcladal.github.io/kwics.html target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">tutorial</a> from LADAL on concordancing uses a notebook containing R code as a method of extracting concordance data.</p><h4 id=clusters-and-collocations>Clusters and collocations</h4><p>Two methods can be used for counting the co-occurrence of items in text.
Clusters (sometimes known as n-grams) are sequences of adjacent items. A bigram is a sequence of two items, a trigram (3-gram) is a sequence of three items and so on. n-grams are types made up of more than one item, and therefore we can count the number of tokens of each n-gram in texts. n-grams are also the basis for a class of language models. (Google created a very large data set of English n-grams in developing their language-based algorithms and this <a href=https://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv3.html target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">data is available</a>.)
Collocations are patterns of co-occurrence in which the items are not necessarily adjacent. An example of why this is important is verbs and their objects in English. The object of a verb is a noun phrase and in many cases the first item in an English noun phrase is a determiner. This means that for many transitive verbs, the bigram <em>verb the</em> will occur quite frequently. But it is much more interesting to know whether there are patterns relating verbs and the entities which are their objects.
Collocation analysis uncovers such patterns by looking at co-occurrences within a window of a certain size, for example three tokens on either side of the target. Collocation analysis gives information about the frequency of the co-occurrence of words and also a statistical measure of how likely that frequency is, given the overall frequencies of the terms in the corpus. Measures commonly applied include <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Mutual Information</a> scores and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function#Log-likelihood target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Log-Likelihood</a> scores.
Collocations can also tell us about the meanings of words. If a word has collocates which fall into semantically distinct groups, this can indicate ambiguity or polysemy. And if different words share patterns of collocation, this can be evidence that the words are at least partial synonyms.</p><p>This graphic shows collocation relations in Darwin’s Origin of Species visualised as a network - the likelihood of a pair of words occurring in close proximity in the text is indicated by the weight of the line linking them:</p><figure><img src=https://atap.edu.au/collocation_network.png alt="Collocation patterns in *Origin of Species* as a network"></figure><p>This article uses bigram frequencies as part of an analysis of language change:</p><div class=reference><font size=3>Schweinberger, Martin. 2021.

It tells us which words are more frequent (or less frequent) than would be expected in one text compared to another text and gives an estimate of the probability of the result. Keyword analysis uses two corpora: a <strong>target</strong> corpus, which is the material of interest, and a <strong>comparison</strong> corpus. Frequency lists are made for each corpus and then frequency of individual types in each corpus are compared. Keywords are ones which occur more ( or less) frequently in the target corpus than expected given the reference corpus.
The <strong>keyness</strong> of individual items is a quantitative measure of how unexpected the frequency is; chi-square is a one possible measure of this, but a log-likelihood measure is more commonly used. Positive keywords are words which occur more commonly than expected; negative keywords are words which occur less commonly than expected.</p><p>This visualisation shows a comparison of positive distinguishing words for three texts (Charles Darwin’s <em>Origin</em>, Herman Melville’s <em>Moby Dick</em>, and George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>), words that occur more commonly than we expect in one text when taking the other two texts as a comparison:</p><figure><img src=https://atap.edu.au/keywords.png alt="Keywords from three texts"></figure><p>This paper applies keyword analysis to Australian text data sourced from a television series script:</p><div class=reference><font size=3>Bednarek, Monika. 2020.

For example, a document (or a portion of a document) can be classified as having positive or negative sentiment. These methods are all examples of supervised machine learning. An algorithm is trained on the basis of annotated data to identify classifiers in the data – features which correlate in some way with the annotated classifications. If the algorithm achieves good results on testing data (classified by human judgment), then it can be used to classify unannotated data.</p><h4 id=document-classification>Document Classification</h4><p>The task here is to assign documents to categories automatically. An everyday example of this procedure is spam filtering of email that may be applied by internet service providers and also within email applications. An example of this technique being used in research would be automatically identifying historical court records as referring either to violent crimes, property offences, or other crimes.</p><p>The following two articles taken together give an account of a technique for partially automating the training phase of classification and then of how the classifiers allowed researchers to access new information in a large and complex text.</p><div class=reference><font size=3>Leavy, Susan, Mark T Keane & Emilie Pine. 2019.

In simple cases, this can mean sorting documents into those which a express a positive view and those which express a negative view (with a neutral position sometimes also included). Such classifications are the basis for aggregated ratings - for example, online listings of movies and restaurants. A sentiment value is assigned to individual reviews then an aggregate score is calculated based on those values and that aggregate score is the rating presented to the user. More sophisticated sentiment analysis can assign values on a scale. Some sentiment analysis tools use dictionaries of terms with sentiment values assigned to those terms; these are known as pre-trained or pre-determined classifiers.</p><p>The following figure shows the results of the sentiment analysis of four texts (<em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> by Mark Twain, <em>1984</em> by George Orwell, <em>The Colour out of Space</em> by H.P.Lovecraft, and <em>On the Origin of Species</em> by Charles Darwin) using the Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (Mohammad and Turney 2013).

Seemingly simple classifiers are used for this task as they are assumed to be less open to conscious manipulation by writers. For example, comparative patterns of occurrence of function words such as <em>the</em> and <em>a/an</em> are considered a better classifier than occurrences of content words. Character n-grams, that is sequences of characters of a specified length, have also proven to be a good classifier for use in this task.

The underlying assumption is that different topics will tend to be associated with different words, different documents will tend to be associated with different topics, and therefore the distribution of words across documents allows us to find topics. The complete model includes the strength of association (or probability) between each word and each topic, and between each topic and each document. A topic consists of a group of words and it is up to the researcher to decide if a semantically coherent interpretation can be given to any of the topics recovered. The number of topics to be recovered is specified in advance.</p><p>The example visualisation below is based on topic modeling of the State of the Union addresses given by US presidents, and shows the relative importance of different topics over time. In the right hand part of the figure, the words most closely linked to each topic are listed; the researcher has not attempted to give labels to these (although in some cases, it is not too hard to imagine what labels we might use). Note also that words are not uniquely linked to topics - for example, the word <em>state</em> is closely linked to seven of the topics in this model.</p><figure><img src=https://atap.edu.au/topic_models.png alt="Topics in the State of the Union Address over time"></figure><p>The Wikipedia entry for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">topic models</a> gives a more detailed explanation of the process.</p><p>This <a href=https://slcladal.github.io/topicmodels.html target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">topic modeling tutorial</a> from LADAL uses R coding to process textual data and generate a topic model from that data.</p><p><i>Poetics</i> 41(6) is a journal issue devoted to the use of topic models in literary studies: the introduction to the journal (by Mohr and Bogdanov: <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2013.10.001 target=_blank><a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2013.10.001 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2013.10.001</a></a>) provides a useful overview of the method.</p><p>And this paper uses topic modeling as one tool in trying to improve access to a huge collection of scholarly literature:</p><div class=reference><font size=3>Mimno, David. 2012.

Analysis of social networks is a classic application of the method, but words and documents can also be thought of as entities and the relationships between them can then be analysed with this method. (see example visualisation of Darwin’s <em>Origin of Species</em> above)
